      <p> I help students complete assignments, on time and with
        immaculate attention to detail. I also assist job seekers to
        write effective selection criteria to help them get an
        interview. </p>
      <h2>BACKGROUND:</h2>
      <p>I have a Bachelor of Arts from the Australian National
        University, and a PhD in English from the University of Western
        Australia. I completed three years of a Bachelor of Science
        (Physiotherapy) at Notre Dame University, ranking in the top 10%
        of students. I hold a Graduate Diploma in Information and
        Library Studies from Curtin University. I now work at three
        different libraries in Perth, helping students and the public
        improve their information literacy. I previously worked as a
        Tutor in the Department of English and Cultural Studies at UWA,
        and am currently an Honorary Research Fellow at UWA. I am
        available by appointment at a meeting room at UWA. For $30 I
        will spend half an hour with you helping you to improve the
        quality of your assignment, essay, or job application. I am very
        effective with my use of time, and you will see big improvements
        in the quality of your work.</p>
